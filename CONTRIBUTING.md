## üõ† Changes to the main repo

If are comfortable working with GitHub and Git, the following steps should be straightforward. For more general information visit [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en) and [Git Documentation](https://git-scm.com/doc). 

1. **Fork the repository**
   Start by forking the repository to your own GitHub account. You can do this by clicking the "Fork" button on the top right of the repository page.

2. **Clone the original repository**
   Clone the original repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ironcalc/IronCalc.git
   cd IronCalc
   ```


3. **Add your fork as a remote**
    Add your forked repository as a remote named fork:

    ```bash
    git remote add fork https://github.com/<your-username>/IronCalc.git
    ```
4. **Create a new branch**
    Always create a new branch for your changes to keep your work isolated:

    ```bash
    git checkout -b your-feature-name
    ```
5. **Make changes**
    Implement your changes, improvements, or bug fixes. Make sure to follow any coding style or project-specific guidelines.

6. **Commit your changes**
    Write clear and concise commit messages:

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Brief description of your changes"
    ```
7. **Push to your fork**
    Push your branch to your forked repository:
    ```bash
    git push fork your-feature-name
    ````

8. **Create a Pull Request (PR)**
   Follow the steps on the terminal or go to the orig IronCalc repository, and click on "New Pull Request."
   Ensure your PR has a clear title and description explaining the purpose of your changes.

Always start from the main branch in a clean state. `git pull` will generally get the lastest changes form the original repo.

You should make sure that your changes are properly tested.
