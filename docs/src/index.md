# About IronCalc

IronCalc is in its infancy, although we aim at supporting many of common spreadsheet features you might find some important features missing in your normal workflow.

If the lack of a particular feature is stopping you from using IronCalc please let us know and we will try to prioritize that over others.

With those caveats IronCalc is perfectly usable and if your workflow doesn't require non supported features, you can use it right away!

IronCalc intends to be Excel compatible, if a formula is evaluated differently in Excel than in IronCalc it is most likely a bug.

::: warning
You’re looking at IronCalc’s end-user documentation. For more dev-focused docs, take a look at our API docs or Python docs.
