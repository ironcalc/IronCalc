# Programming IronCalc

IronCal is a spreadsheet _engine_ first. This means you can load the engine from a myriad of places. The very same computational engine that you use in the [browser](https://app.ironcalc.com) you can use from your favourite programming language.

Using IronCalc programmatically means you can create spreadsheets on the fly. Maybe you want to create reports for your users or maybe you want to run the spreadsheet with a series of inputs and use the outputs.
