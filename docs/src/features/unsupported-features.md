# Important Unsupported Features

Although IronCalc is ready for use, it’s important to understand its current limitations. Below, we list the most significant missing features of a modern spreadsheet engine. If you can live without these features for now, IronCalc might be the product you’re looking for.

## **Arrays and Array Formulas** <Badge type="info" text="Planned" />

IronCalc currently does not implement arrays or array formulas. These are planned and are coming very soon, as they are the highest priority on the engine side.

## **Only English Supported**

The MVP version of IronCalc supports only the English language. However, version 1.0 will include support for three languages: **English**, **German**, and **Spanish**.

## **No Autocomplete**

Spreadsheet users are accustomed to autocompleting sequences (e.g., filling in `4, 5, 6` after `1, 2, 3`). This feature is not yet available in IronCalc but is on the roadmap for future updates.

## **Charts** <Badge type="info" text="Not Planned for v1" />

Although charts are an essential feature for any serious spreadsheet program, they are not planned for version 1.0. Adding chart support will become a high priority after the release of version 1.0.
