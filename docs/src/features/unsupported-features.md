# Important Unsupported Features

Although IronCalc is ready for use, it’s important to understand its current limitations. Below, we list the most significant missing features of a modern spreadsheet engine. If you can live without these features for now, IronCalc might be the product you’re looking for.

## **Arrays and Array Formulas** <Badge type="info" text="Planned" />

IronCalc currently does not implement arrays or array formulas. These are planned and are coming very soon, as they are the highest priority on the engine side.

## **Charts** <Badge type="info" text="Planned" />

Although charts are an essential feature for any serious spreadsheet program, they are not planned for version 1.0. Adding chart support will become a high priority after the release of version 1.0.

## **Collaboration** <Badge type="info" text="Planned" />

Real-time collaboration—where multiple users can view and edit the same spreadsheet simultaneously—is not yet available in IronCalc. Currently, spreadsheets cannot be edited concurrently from different devices or by different users. This feature is on the roadmap for future development.
