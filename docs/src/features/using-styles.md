# Using Styles

IronCalc lets you customize the appearance of your data with a variety of style options:

- **Background colors**: Apply colors to cell backgrounds.
- **Text colors**: Change the color of text within cells.
- **Borders**: Add or modify borders around cells, including **border color** and **line thickness** (thin, medium, or thick).
- **Font styles**: Use **bold**, *italic*, <u>underline</u>, or ~~strikethrough~~ text for emphasis.
- **Alignment**: Align text **horizontally** and **vertically**, with options to center on both axes.
- **Text wrapping**: Keep the default text overflow, or enable wrapping within cells.

You can also **show or hide grid lines** for a cleaner layout.

## Adjusting Row and Column Dimensions

Customize the layout by modifying:

- **Row heights**: Adjust the height of rows to fit your content.
- **Column widths**: Resize columns for optimal visibility.

## Freezing Rows and Columns

You can freeze one or more rows and columns so they stay visible while scrolling. To do this, right-click anywhere on the canvas and use the **context menu**. Frozen rows and columns remain fixed while the rest of the content scrolls.

## Copying and Pasting Styles

Styles can be **copied and pasted** from one cell or range to another. Simply copy a cell with the desired style and paste it elsewhere to apply the same formatting.

To clear formatting, use the **Clear formatting** button on the left side of the toolbar.
