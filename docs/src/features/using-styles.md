# Using Styles

In IronCalc you can aldo customize the appearance of your data with a variety of style options:

- **Background Colors**: Apply colors to cell backgrounds.
- **Text Colors**: Change the color of the text within cells.
- **Borders**: Add or modify borders around cells, including **border color** and **line thickness** (thin, medium or thick).
- **Font Styles**: Use **bold**, _italics_, _underlined_, or **strikethrough** text for emphasis.
- **Alignment**: Align text both **horizontally** and **vertically**, with options to **align middle** for both axes for perfect centering.

You can also **show or hide grid lines** for a cleaner layout.

## Adjusting Row and Column Dimensions

You can also customize the layout by modifying:

- **Row Heights**: Adjust the height of rows to fit your content.
- **Column Widths**: Resize columns for optimal visibility of data.

## Copying and Pasting Styles

Styles can be easily **copied and pasted** from one cell or cell range to another. Simply copy the cell with the desired style and paste it into another cell or range to apply the same formatting.
