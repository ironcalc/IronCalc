# The desktop application

A standalone desktop application for Windows, macOS, and Linux is not yet available. Once released, it will allow you to work with spreadsheets offline without needing a browser. This feature is planned but developement hasn't started yet. [Follow the progress here](https://github.com/ironcalc/IronCalc/issues/57).
