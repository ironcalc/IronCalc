# Sharing Files

IronCalc makes it easy to share your files with others. Follow these steps to share a sheet and understand how sharing works.

## How to Share a File

1. **Click the Share Button**:  
   In the web app, click the **"Share"** button located in the top-right corner of the interface.

2. **Copy the URL**:  
   Upon clicking, the sharing URL will be automatically copied to your clipboard.

3. **Share the URL**:  
   Paste the URL into a message, email, or browser to share it or open the sheet.

## How Sharing Works

- **Snapshot of the Original Sheet**:  
   When the URL is used to open the sheet, it displays the version of the sheet that was visible when the **"Share"** button was clicked. Please note that **any changes made to the original sheet after sharing will not be reflected in the shared version**.

- **Changes in the Shared Version**:  
  Any modifications made in the shared sheet (even if it’s an existing sheet) will **not** overwrite or affect the original sheet.
