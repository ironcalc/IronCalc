# Managing Workbooks

All your created sheets can be accessed from the **Workbook Sidebar**. To display it, click the button in the top-left corner of the window. From there, you can:

- View all existing workbooks, ordered by date (today, last 30 days, and older)
- Create new blank workbooks
- Download the existing workbook as .xlsx
- Pin workbooks to the top of the list
- Duplicate workbooks
- Delete workbooks

This helps you keep your workbooks organized and makes sharing simple and straightforward.
