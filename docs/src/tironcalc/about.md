# About TironCalc

**TironCalc**, or **Tiron** for friends, is a TUI (Terminal User Interface) for **IronCalc**. Itâ€™s designed to bring the functionality of IronCalc to the command line, using the [**ratatui**](https://github.com/ratatui-org/ratatui) library.

## Inspiration

TironCalc is inspired by earlier terminal-based spreadsheet tools:

- James Gosling of Java fame created [sc](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sc_(spreadsheet_calculator)>) the spreadsheet calculator.
- AndrÃ©s Martinelli has been maintaining [sc-im](https://github.com/andmarti1424/sc-im), the spreadsheet calculator improvised.
